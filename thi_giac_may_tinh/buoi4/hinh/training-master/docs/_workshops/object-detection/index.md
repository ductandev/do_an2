## What you will build
In this workshop, you’ll build an app that lets you use your own custom-trained models to detect objects.
You’ll create an IBM Cloud Object Storage instance to store your labeled data, then after your data is ready, you’ll learn how to create a Watson Machine Learning instance to train your own custom model on top-of-the-line GPUs.
After your model has completed training, you can simply plug the model into your application.
