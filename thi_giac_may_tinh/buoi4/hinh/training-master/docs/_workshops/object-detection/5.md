Creating a Watson Machine Leaning instance gives us a reliable place to train, deploy and test machine learning models on specialized infrastructure. This allows us to set off several experiments simultaneously, taking advantage of multiple high-end GPUs. Watson Machine Learning supports a wide collection of machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, Caffe, PyTorch, Spark MLlib, scikit learn, xgboost and SPSS.

IBM Cloud offers a lite tier of Watson Machine Leaning, which includes 50 hours of compute for free per month. (this is what we will be using throughout the tutorial)

To create a Watson Machine Learning instance, navigate back to your [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://ibm.biz/cloud-annotations-sign-up) and click the **Create resource** button.
